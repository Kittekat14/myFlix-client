# myFlix-client
 The client-side and user interface for the movie database "ActorInspector".

 Here the user can find a lot of interesting movies for his or her movie evening. It delivers infos about genres, directors, actors and more. The Application is connected to an MongoDB Atlas Database, where I put in all the best movies I could find! Gladly, we live in such good times, that there are movies coming out almost each day! 
 
 I don't know why people nowadays love shows more that movies, since a movie is a complete story and you don't get annoyed by unsatisfying cliffhangers (at least, if there are no sequels)! 

 So, get down to business and choose something for you!
