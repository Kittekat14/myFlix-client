 "The client-side and user interface for the movie database "ActorInspector".

 Here the user can find a lot of interesting movies for his or her movie evening. It delivers infos about genres, directors, actors of each movie and more. The Application is connected to an MongoDB Atlas Database, where I put in all the best movies I could find! Gladly, we live in such good times, that there are movies coming out almost every day! 
 
 I don't know why people nowadays love shows more that movies, since a movie is a complete story and you don't get annoyed by unsatisfying cliffhangers (at least, if there are no sequels)! 

 So, get down to business and choose something for you!
