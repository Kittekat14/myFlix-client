# myFlix-client
The client-side and user interface for the Movie-API and database "ActorInspector".
Here the user can find a lot of interesting movies for their movie evening. It delivers infos about genres, directors, actors and more. The Application is connected to a MongoDB Database, where I put in all the best movies I could find!

## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so I can save data about my favorite
movies.
